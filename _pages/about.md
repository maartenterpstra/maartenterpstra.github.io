I am a PhD student in the Radiotherapy department at the [University Medical Center Utrecht (UMC Utrecht)](https://www.umcutrecht.nl). This is part of the Graduate School of Life Sciences and part of the [Univeristy of Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/). Our work is focused on MR-guided Radiotherapy, and I work on the application of Deep Learning for real-time MRI reconstruction. This is especially useful in the context of the recently developed [MR-Linac](https://www.philips.co.uk/healthcare/education-resources/publications/hotspot/mr-linac).

When I'm not doing research I'm most likely at home playing games (either digital or analog) or wasting time on the internet. Sometimes I also practise in some sports -- generally squash, otherwise at the gym. Through no fault but my own I've become a collector of (vaporwave) vinyl and Russian/Former USSR made mechanical watches.
