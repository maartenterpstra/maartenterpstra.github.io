I am a PhD student in the Radiotherapy department at the [University Medical Center Utrecht (UMC Utrecht)](https://www.umcutrecht.nl). This is part of the Graduate School of Life Sciences and the [Univeristy of Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/). Our work focuses on MR-guided radiotherapy, and I work on the application of Deep Learning for real-time MRI reconstruction. Besides the obvious benefits of real-time MRI it is being done with the recently devloped [MR-Linac](https://www.philips.co.uk/healthcare/education-resources/publications/hotspot/mr-linac) in mind.

When I’m not doing research I’m most likely at home playing games (either digital or analog), trying to learn to play the piano or wasting time on the internet. I also rarely do some sports – generally squash, otherwise at the gym. Through no fault but my own I’ve become a collector of [(vaporwave) vinyl](https://www.discogs.com/user/mlt92/collection).
